# PROJECT_DJ_Helper

This mini project represents an console application written in *.NET Core 3.1*.<br/>
The idea here was to build application that can analyze list of tracks in directory, search for information about <br/>each of track's *key*, and finally give some suggestions on how to mix this tracks with each other.

## **Key features:**

- 2 modes: give mix suggestion just for one song, or for whole list of tracks
- Usage of Spotify API (their sound analyzer can provide information about key for each track)
- 2 ways to save result: save suggested mix in txt file (ordered tracks), or rename files in directory

## **Technologies used:**

- *Platform:* .NET Core 3.1 
- *Other*: usage of Spotify API 

**NOTE:**  to test/use this app you need your personal client ID and client Secret. Thats Spotify API rule. To get them, you need to register your app via Spotify Developer account.<br/> Check this link for more information: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login
